# Password-Encryption
This C++ program modifies a given password by applying a character shift to its consonants and then reversing the entire string. The user first inputs the password and an integer key. The program iterates through each character of the password, checking if it is a vowel using the checkVowel function; vowels remain unchanged, while consonants are shifted forward in the ASCII table by the specified key. If the resulting value exceeds 'z', it wraps around to start from 'a'. After processing the characters, the program reverses the modified password and outputs the final result. For example, if the input password is "hello" with a key of 2, the consonants are shifted to produce "jeenn", which is then reversed to "nneej". Overall, the program transforms the input password through these character manipulations and reversal, showcasing the fundamental idea of encryption.
